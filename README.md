- 👋 Hi, I’m @Diligent-child, and I am currently a graduate student, majoring in computer technology.
- 👀 When I was undergraduate, I had self-taught front-end knowledge of HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, etc. The projects in Github were all from my undergraduate.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning decision analysis direction.
- 💞 Looking forward to our mutual learning and communication.
- 📫 If you have any questions, you can contact me by email 342359969@qq.com
